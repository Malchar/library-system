Library Management System
This is the website for the library management system. There are three pages. The first page is the landing, which has a login form, a list of news, and an "about" section which includes multimedia. There is also a navigation section at the bottom of the page which links to all three pages of the site.
The second page is the registration page. This page consists of a form with validation. It is used by a client to setup their account.
The third page is the controls page. It includes control functions that can be used by a client and/or employee to manipulate the underlying database. Please note, the database is not connected at this time, so the functions are placeholders. The first function is a search, which currently populates the results table with whatever information is input. There is also a checkout funciton in the employee section. This currently has no functionality.
